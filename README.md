===========================

This project contains a set of code samples for the "Using Zend Framework 2"
book by Oleg Krivtsov. Zend Framework 2 is a modern PHP web development framework intended for
building professionally looking, scalable and secure web-sites, which are 
easy to test and maintain.

The book's text is illustrated with code samples. Each sample is a complete web-site
you can install and run yourself to see Zend Framework 2 in action. You even can use
the samples as a base for your own web sites.

Code samples are organized by chapters. The structure
of the code archive is presented below. 

	chapter1
		(no samples)
	chapter2	
		helloworld
	chapter3
		formdemo
	...

For example, if you want to see the code examples for Chapter 2, 
go to the `chapter2` subdirectory of the top-level code directory.
