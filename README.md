building professionally looking, scalable and secure web-sites, which are 
easy to test and maintain.

The book's text is illustrated with code examples that you may want to
reproduce yourself. It may be difficult for a novice to write code without 
mistakes. If you are stuck or can not understand why your code does not work, 
you can download and install the complete sample web application from this page. 

Each sample described on this page is a complete web-site you can install and 
run yourself to see Zend Framework 2 in action. You even can use the samples as 
a base for your own web sites.
